# Discriminative Term Weights  (DTW)
## A Supervised Attribute based Filter for the Weka Data Mining Tool

**Description**

This is a simple Java implementation of the DTW Algorithm that I implemented during one of my research internships, this is a prototype for the implementation of the PhD thesis of Dr. Khurrum Junejo, who was my supervisor for the internship.

**Importing to Weka**

Importing this file is straightforward, just copy the given DTW.java to the weka source folder (./src/main/java/weka/filters/supervised/attribute at the time of creating the source code). Additionally you may want to manually include it into your Eclipse/Netbeans project if the file is not automatically detected.
